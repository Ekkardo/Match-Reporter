# Match-Reporter
A collection of custom Overwatch 2 match logs. This repository just gathers and collects .txt files committed by either moderators(forks, contributors) or by me (admin)
This repository is meant as a temporary storage for aggregating the data of each match log as soon as possible on my clients end.
The content of the log files are pre-formatted by the Overwatch 2 workshop engine in a way to make it easier to convert the data and fill them in relational databases later. 
Please do not change or alter the formatting as a moderator or anyone, at committing phase, i'll check any aberration and onward as such decline committs and further processings with them.
Just commit the raw pre-formatted log files aand we are good to go. 
Thank you very much! 
Best regards 
Ekkardo aka Kizaru.
